# DevOps Maturity Model

This model is a tool to help gauge where your organization is on the path to DevOps awesomeness.  

This is based largely on the table featured in http://blog.devopsguys.com/2013/02/06/maturing-the-continuous-delivery-pipeline/

My goal is to end up with a generic-but-specific set of measures anyone can use.  If there is something you would like to see (or fix) on this matrix please follow the contribution guidelines below.  If you want to customize for your own organization fork it and go to town!
